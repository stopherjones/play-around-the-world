<p class="subtitle">An attempt to travel the world on Board Game Arena</p>

<div class="container" style="max-width: 750px; margin-top: 2rem;">
    <p>Born out of an 'Around the World in 80 Games' event, <strong>Play Around the World</strong> attempts to provide a (fairly) comprehensive list of games on Board Game Arena that geographically or thematically represent as many countries around the world as possible.</p>

    <p>The original idea was to play games where the main focus is a country, its cities, towns, regions or cultures.</p>
    
    <p>Games marked with an asterisk (*) do include that country (or its towns, cities, regions or cultures), but only in a minor way, usually among a number of other countries - Ticket to Ride Europe, or RallymanGT, for example.</p>
